            <h2>BBQ Ribs</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>1 slab Baby Back Ribs</p>
            <p>4 tablespoons of Memphis Dust</p>
            <p>1 teaspoon of Salt (1/4 teaspoon per pound of meat)</p>
            <p>1 cup of BBQ Sauce (optional)</p>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Rinse.</strong> Rinse the ribs in cool water to remove any bone bits from the butchering.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Skin 'n' Trim.</strong> Ribs are one of my go-to picks for smoking because they don't involve a ton of extra trimming and prep - though a little bit of work goes a long way to making perfect fall off the bone juicy ribs.(Try to remove the silver skin)</p>
            <p><strong>3. Salt.</strong> Salt is important. It penetrates deep and amplifies flavor. It helps proteins retain moisture. Use about 1/4 teaspoon per pound. You can simply eyeball it by sprinkling on the same amount of salt you would sprinkle on the ribs if they were served to you unsalted.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Rub.</strong> Anytime before cooking time, just coat the meat with a thin layer of water. The water helps dissolve the spices. Then sprinkle enough Memphis Dust.That is about 2 tablespoons per side depending on the size of the slab. Spread the Memphis Dust on the meat and rub it in.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Fire up</strong> your barbecue smoker or set up your grill for 2-zone cooking. 2-zone cooking on a grill is the secret to keeping the temp down so you don't shrink the proteins and make the meat tough.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Smoke.</strong> Add about 4 ounces of dry wood at this time. Put the wood as close to the flame as possible. For me, Oak wood is the best wood for smoking rib.</p>
            <p> <strong>7. Relax.</strong> Put the slabs in the cooker in indirect heat, meaty side up, close the lid, go drink a beer, read a book, or do yoga.</p>
            <p> <strong>8. More Smoke.</strong> When the smoke dwindles after 20 to 30 minutes, add another 4 ounces of wood. That's it. Stop adding wood. On your first attempt, resist the temptation</p>
            <p> <strong>9. The Texas Crutch</strong> This optional trick involves wrapping the slab in foil with about an ounce of water for up to an hour to speed cooking and tenderize a bit.</p>
